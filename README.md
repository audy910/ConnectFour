# ConnectFour
version 1 (greenfoot)
Description
This game is a basic connect four, two-player game. The objective is to be the first to have your color make a line of four.

How to play:
Player one will be yellow and player two red. The players should switch off clicking numbers 1 through 7 until one player connects four. Whoever gets four in a row first wins! The program does not yet say when there is a winner, so this is for the players to determine. If one of the numbers is held down for too long, the other player will be placed in the same column.
